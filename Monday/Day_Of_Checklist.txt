================================================================================
INTERVIEW STRUCTURE & TIMELINE (60-90 MINUTES TYPICAL)
================================================================================

SEGMENT 1: INTRODUCTIONS (5-10 minutes)
---------------------------------------
WHAT TO EXPECT:
- Jakub introduces himself and his role
- He explains the interview format
- Asks you to introduce yourself

YOUR APPROACH:
✓ Keep intro concise (2 minutes max)
✓ Structure: Current role → Relevant experience → Why monday.com
✓ Example: "I'm a Senior MLOps Engineer at [Company] where I build and 
  maintain ML infrastructure serving 10M+ daily users. I have 5+ years 
  experience deploying models on Kubernetes, with strong focus on 
  observability and cost optimization. I'm excited about monday.com because 
  of your multi-region architecture and AI-first product strategy."

✓ Show energy and enthusiasm
✓ Make eye contact (look at camera)
✓ Listen carefully to format explanation
✓ Ask clarifying questions if needed

NOTES TO TAKE:
- Jakub's specific role/team details
- Interview segments and timing
- Any specific topics he mentions

================================================================================

SEGMENT 2: SYSTEM DESIGN (30-40 minutes)
---------------------------------------
WHAT TO EXPECT:
- Real engineering challenge (likely ML infrastructure focused)
- Examples: "Design a multi-tenant model serving platform" or "How would you 
  implement observability for ML services at scale?"
- May be open-ended or have specific constraints

YOUR APPROACH:

STEP 1: CLARIFY (3-5 minutes)
✓ ASK QUESTIONS before jumping in:
  - "What's the expected scale? QPS, number of models, data volume?"
  - "What are the latency requirements?"
  - "Is this multi-tenant? Any data isolation requirements?"
  - "What's the existing infrastructure? Are we on AWS, K8s, etc.?"
  - "Any constraints? Budget, timeline, existing tools to integrate with?"
  - "What are the key success criteria?"

✓ Restate the problem in your own words
✓ Get confirmation you understand correctly

STEP 2: HIGH-LEVEL DESIGN (5-10 minutes)
✓ Start with a diagram (use drawing tool or describe verbally)
✓ Sketch main components:
  - Entry point (API Gateway, Load Balancer)
  - Core service (inference service, feature store)
  - Data layer (caching, storage)
  - Observability (metrics, logs, traces)
  - Supporting services (auth, rate limiting)

✓ Explain the data flow
✓ Mention key technologies
✓ Check in: "Does this high-level approach make sense?"

STEP 3: DEEP DIVE (15-20 minutes)
Jakub will likely drill into specific areas. Be ready to discuss:

For Kubernetes (his expertise):
- Pod autoscaling (HPA, VPA, custom metrics)
- Node autoscaling (Cluster Autoscaler, Karpenter)
- Resource requests/limits
- GPU scheduling and node selectors
- Multi-tenancy and isolation
- Security (NetworkPolicies, RBAC, Pod Security)

For Observability (his team focus):
- Metrics: what to track, how to collect (Prometheus, Datadog)
- Logging: structured logs, log aggregation
- Tracing: distributed tracing for ML pipelines
- Alerting: what triggers alerts, escalation
- Dashboards: key visualizations

For ML-specific:
- Model versioning and rollback
- Canary deployments
- Feature stores and caching
- Cost optimization (GPU utilization, spot instances)
- Drift detection and monitoring

TIPS:
✓ Think out loud - show your reasoning
✓ Mention trade-offs for each decision
✓ Reference monday.com's context when relevant
✓ Say "I don't know but here's how I'd figure it out" if stuck
✓ Draw diagrams even if you're not artistic
✓ Ask "Would you like me to go deeper on any part?"

STEP 4: HANDLE EDGE CASES (5 minutes)
✓ Discuss failure scenarios
✓ Talk about monitoring and alerts
✓ Mention DR and backup strategies
✓ Scale considerations (10x traffic)

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
✗ Jumping straight to solution without clarifying
✗ Going too deep into one area without covering breadth first
✗ Not considering trade-offs
✗ Ignoring cost, security, or observability
✗ Not checking if interviewer is following
✗ Being too rigid - adapt based on feedback

================================================================================

SEGMENT 3: CODING CHALLENGE (15 minutes)
---------------------------------------
WHAT TO EXPECT:
- CoderPad or similar environment
- Python problem (MLOps focused)
- Examples: API endpoint, batch processing, metrics collection, retry logic
- Time pressure (must work quickly but correctly)

YOUR APPROACH:

MINUTE 0-2: UNDERSTAND
✓ Read problem carefully
✓ Ask clarifying questions:
  - "What should happen if input is invalid?"
  - "Any specific error handling requirements?"
  - "Should I focus on correctness or optimization?"
  - "Any libraries I can use?"
✓ State your approach before coding

MINUTE 2-12: CODE
✓ Start with function signature and type hints
✓ Write clean, readable code
✓ Use meaningful variable names
✓ Add brief comments for complex logic
✓ Handle edge cases
✓ Think about error handling

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:
```python
def batch_inference(requests: List[Request]) -> List[Response]:
    """
    Process a batch of inference requests.
    
    Args:
        requests: List of inference requests
    
    Returns:
        List of responses in same order
    """
    # Validate inputs
    if not requests:
        return []
    
    # Your logic here
    
    # Handle errors
    
    # Return results
```

MINUTE 12-15: TEST & EXPLAIN
✓ Walk through your code
✓ Test with example input
✓ Discuss time/space complexity
✓ Mention potential improvements if you had more time

TIPS:
✓ Talk through your thought process
✓ If stuck, say what you're thinking
✓ Use helper functions to keep code organized
✓ Don't panic if you make a mistake - just fix it
✓ Focus on working code first, optimize if time permits

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
✗ Silence while coding (keep talking!)
✗ Trying to write perfect code (working code first)
✗ Not testing your solution
✗ Ignoring edge cases
✗ Forgetting to import necessary libraries
✗ Not asking clarifying questions

================================================================================

SEGMENT 4: BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONS (15-20 minutes)
---------------------------------------
WHAT TO EXPECT:
- 3-5 behavioral questions
- Mix of technical situations and soft skills
- Common areas: incidents, collaboration, conflict, ownership

LIKELY QUESTIONS:
- "Tell me about a time you dealt with a production outage"
- "Describe a situation where you had to collaborate with data scientists"
- "Tell me about a time you had to make a cost optimization decision"
- "Describe a technical disagreement you had and how you resolved it"
- "Tell me about a time you failed and what you learned"

YOUR APPROACH:
✓ Use STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
✓ Keep each story to 2-3 minutes
✓ Be specific with metrics and details
✓ Show ownership and learning
✓ Connect to monday.com's context where possible

TIPS:
✓ Listen to the full question before answering
✓ Pick a relevant story that highlights strengths
