=== SYSTEM DESIGN FRAMEWORK ===

For any system design question, follow this structure:
1. CLARIFY REQUIREMENTS

   - Latency: real-time vs batch, SLA requirements
   - Multi-tenancy: isolation needs, compliance
   - Constraints: cost budget, existing systems

2. HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE
   - Sketch: gateway -> service -> model -> data stores
   - Components: inference service, feature store, monitoring
   - Multi-region: regional deployments, data locality

3. DEEP DIVE KEY AREAS
   - Scalability: autoscaling, load balancing, caching
   - Reliability: HA, DR, circuit breakers, retries

   - Security: auth/authz, encryption, isolation

4. TRADE-OFFS
   - KServe vs custom service
   - SageMaker vs EKS self-managed
   - Spot vs on-demand
   - Model size vs latency vs cost

=== COMMON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS - QUICK ANSWERS ===

Q: How do you handle model version rollback?
A: GitOps with ArgoCD - revert Git commit triggers automatic deployment of previous version. Also keep last-known-good model artifacts in S3 with version tags.

Q: How to detect model drift?
A: Monitor prediction distribution changes (KL divergence), input data statistics, compare accuracy on validation set over time. Alert if metrics deviate beyond threshold.

Q: GPU cost optimization strategies?
A: Autoscaling to zero, spot instances, FP16 quantization, batching, right-sized instances, Savings Plans for baseline.

Q: Multi-tenant data isolation?
A: Account-scoped API calls with JWT, separate namespaces if needed, network policies, RBAC, audit logs per tenant.

Q: Observability for ML services?
A: Prometheus metrics (latency, error rate, prediction dist), structured logging (trace ID, account ID), OpenTelemetry traces, Grafana dashboards, Datadog APM.

Q: Canary deployment for models?
A: Argo Rollouts with progressive traffic: 5% -> 25% -> 50% -> 100%. Automated rollback on error rate > threshold or latency spike.

Q: Kubernetes security best practices?
A: Pod Security Standards (restricted), RBAC with least privilege, network policies, image scanning, secrets via AWS Secrets Manager, IRSA for AWS access.

Q: How to scale ML inference?
A: HPA on QPS/latency, dynamic batching, GPU node autoscaling with Karpenter, load balancing across replicas, caching frequent requests.

=== BEHAVIORAL STAR EXAMPLES - KEY POINTS ===

SITUATION: Production ML service latency spike
TASK: Restore SLO within 30 minutes
ACTION: Checked metrics -> identified batch size issue -> scaled GPU nodes -> rolled back model -> implemented auto-rollback
RESULT: Restored p99 latency from 3s to 500ms in 20 min, prevented customer impact

SITUATION: Research team had high-accuracy model but slow (2s latency)
TASK: Make it production-ready with <500ms latency
ACTION: Profiled model -> applied FP16 quantization -> optimized tokenization -> added batching -> GPU acceleration
RESULT: Reduced latency to 300ms, 5% accuracy drop acceptable, deployed successfully

SITUATION: GPU costs skyrocketing ($50K/month)
TASK: Cut costs by 50% without impacting performance
ACTION: Implemented autoscaling to zero, added spot instances, negotiated Savings Plan, optimized batch sizes
RESULT: Reduced costs to $23K/month (54% savings), maintained SLAs

SITUATION: Security audit found ML service vulnerabilities
TASK: Harden infrastructure to pass audit
ACTION: Added image scanning, implemented RBAC, enabled network policies, integrated Secrets Manager, added audit logging
RESULT: Passed audit, zero critical findings, became template for other services
